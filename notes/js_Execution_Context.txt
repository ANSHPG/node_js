{ } -> global Execution context -> this
-> global execution context
-> functioon execution context 
-> eval execution context 

{} -> memory creation phase 
   -> execution phase 

step 1
1. global execution -> this
2. memory phase ->
    val1 -> undefined
    val2 -> undefined
    addNum -> defination
    result1 -> undefined
    result2 -> undefined

3.execution phase ->
    val1 = 10
    val2 = 5
    addNum = {
        newVariableEnviornment: {
            val1: undefined,
            val2: undefined,
            total: undefind
        }
        executionMethod: {
            num1: 10,
            numw2: 5,
            total: 15
        }
    }
    delete addNum
    result1 = 15
    result2 = {
        newVariableEnviornment: {
            val1: undefined,
            val2: undefined,
            total: undefind
        }
        executionMethod: {
            num1: 10,
            numw2: 2,
            total: 20
        }
    }
    delete addNum

    stack = LIFO
